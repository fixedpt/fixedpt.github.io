# About
I use this blog to write about things I care about.

# A little about me:

I am a Sr Data Scientist at IBM.

In 2014, I obtained my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Illnois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are at the intersection of game theory, control theory, and machine learning.

I have 4 kids; 2 boys, 2 girls.
